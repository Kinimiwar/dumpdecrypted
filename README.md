(C) Copyright 2011-2014 Stefan Esser


Compile:

First adjust the Makefile if you have a different iOS SDK installed.

And then just: make

Usage:

Before running the decryption dumper, the dumpdecrypted.dylib should be signed.

```
$ security find-identity -p codesigning -v
  1) 998971859D4D2E74F "iPhone Developer: ..."
  2) CF57726A2BA2D8B57 "Mac Developer: ..."
       2 valid identities found
$ codesign -f -s 998971859D4D2E74F... dumpdecrypted.dylib
dumpdecrypted.dylib: replacing existing signature

```

```
